            <p> 

              As a therapist I engage in regular supervision, which means 

              discussing aspects of my work with an experienced independent 

              supervisor and the Manager. This is to ensure I am working 

              ethically and within my competence. There are also things I must 

              pass on to others. For example: 

            </p>

                </li> 

                <li> 

                  When there is a serious risk of harm to yourself or someone 

                  else. 

                </li> 

                <li> 

                  If you make a disclosure about a child or vulnerable adult 

                  that may be at risk of harm / has been harmed ( a child is 

                  anyone under 18 years of age ) 

                </li> 

                <li>

            <p>
              Welcome to Axle counselling, where you can find the support and
              guidance you need to navigate life's challenges using a
              Person-centred approach. I am committed to create a safe and
              confidential space, providing a listening service supporting you
              to explore difficult thoughts and feelings. Listening is a skill
              which involves the simplicity of being fully present, a freedom
              from distraction with no agenda other than to understand your
              unique needs and experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
              Guided by empathy and unconditional regard my purpose is to help
              you feel heard without judgement, allowing you the time and
              support you need to unravel any problems you may be experiencing.
              Having the freedom to express and understand our discomfort
              enables new perspectives, self-compassion and personal growth,
              untangling the knots of anxiety, guilt and shame. A pivot of
              change.

            <h2>What is person-centred counselling?</h2>

            <div class="breakline"></div>

            <p>
              Person-centred counselling is a humanistic approach that deals
              with the ways in which individuals perceive themselves consciously
              rather than how a counsellor can interpret their unconscious
              thoughts or ideas. The person-centred approach, developed by Carl
              Rogers, is a set of principles that are based on the belief that
              an individual has within themselves vast resources for
              self-understanding and for altering their self-concept, basic
              attitudes, and self-directed behaviour.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 id="expect">What to expect?</h2>

            <div class="breakline"></div>

            <p>
              Person centred counselling is non- directive, I am not going to
              give you advice and guidance but through openness and honesty we
              can figure this out together. One of the biggest advantages of the
              person-centred approach is the promotion of empowerment and
              self-discovery. Unlike some therapeutic approaches that position
              the therapist as the expert, the person-centred approach
              encourages clients to trust their own experiences and insights,
              fostering a deep sense of self-understanding and ability in
              driving forward your mental health journey.
            </p>

            <p>
              The success of person-centred counselling depends on the
              therapeutic alliance (our relationship) I strive to create a
              non-judgmental and supportive environment where clients feel safe
              to say anything, explore their thoughts and feelings without fear
              of criticism or rejection.
            </p>

            <p>
              Person-centred therapy often stands out in areas like client
              satisfaction and the therapeutic relationship when compared to
              other therapeutic methods. Clients often feel more understood and
              accepted in person-centred therapy, as opposed to more directive
              approaches. It's like having a conversation with a friend who
              truly listens, versus one who’s constantly offering advice.
            </p>

            <div id="approach-list">
              <h2>Is Person-Centred Counselling Right for You?</h2>

              <div class="breakline"></div>

              <p>
                The importance of informed decision-making in choosing a therapy
                approach cannot be overstated, what works for one person might
                not be ideal for another.
              </p>
            </div>

            <ul>
              <li>Are you comfortable with self-reflection?</li>

              <li>Do you value personal autonomy in your healing process?</li>

              <li>
                Are you patient with the idea that self – knowledge and personal
                growth is ongoing? Person-centred therapy isn’t a quick fix or a
                magic pill, it requires patience, consistent effort, and a
                willingness to honestly look at yourself.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>
              Person-centred counselling offers empowerment, self-discovery, a
              non-judgmental environment, and the promotion of personal growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you answered yes to these questions, person-centred therapy
              might be a good fit for you. If you’re still unsure, I encourage
              you to reach out to me for a free consultation.

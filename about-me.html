            <h2>I'd like to introduce myself</h2>
            <div class="breakline"></div>
            <p>
              I came into the field of counselling later in life drawing on my
              rich life experiences and passion of working with people. I have
              always served community, either as a volunteer in groups working
              together towards a common aim or in an employed supportive role
              bringing together different organisations; groups and individuals
              to meet; talk and work together, from this I became aware that
              listening is crucial to understanding. Through my Counselling
              training, I learned that listening is a skill which involves the
              simplicity of being fully present, a freedom from distraction with
              no agenda other than to understand and walk alongside the other
              persons unique needs and experiences.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a compassionate down to earth person who came into the field
              of counselling later in life, my passion to understand and support
              people experiencing difficult times has led to years of experience
              in working with a variety of individuals. Allowing my values of
              respect and appreciation of human differences to develop, gaining
              the knowledge and skills required to offer support for people
              feeling distress from the experiences that life brings.
            </p>
            <p>
              I strongly believe counselling has a capacity to heal and help
              people work through painful, traumatic and challenging life
              events. A pivot of change. It’s a space to organise your thoughts
              and make better sense of the situation, a space where you can talk
              confidentially, gaining deeper self-awareness and allowing a more
              balanced perspective of your life.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am a fully qualified, insured experienced therapist. I have a
              wide variety of training, including recognising and responding to
              domestic violence; suicide and self-harm, addictions and people
              affected by dementia.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a skilled listener, I can help you to understand the
              uncomfortable thoughts and emotions which you may feel a burden to
              share with family or friends. I have experience supporting clients
              through:
